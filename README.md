# DOT
A joke programming language that all characters are dots.

When reading a dot, it will run one of the following commands randomly:
* increment the data pointer
* decrement the data pointer
* increment the byte at the data pointer
* decrement the byte at the data pointer
* output the byte at the data pointer
* accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer
* if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to anywhere before the current instruction pointer

## For examples

##### Hello World! (maybe)
```dot
.......................
```

##### Add two numbers (maybe)
```dot
......................
```
